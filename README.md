# Vacui

Vacui is a language about time and emptiness.

When you run the interpreter, you will be greeted with an empty prompt.  
Any characters you type are ignored.  
Only growing the void (with enter) matters.

## Quit the bullshit

Vacui times the gap between enter presses. It then sums the digits of the time to 2 decimal places in seconds.  
If this number is 0-7, it corresponds with one of the 8 brainfuck symbols. If this number is 8, the program terminates and outputs the code you've "written"

The order of tokens is as follows:

| # | X |
|---|---|
| 0 | + |
| 1 | - |
| 2 | < |
| 3 | > |
| 4 | [ |
| 5 | ] |
| 6 | , |
| 7 | . |
